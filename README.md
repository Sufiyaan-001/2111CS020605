# Deployment for Backend

For the start we need to pass our data into the Postman to get the client side server rendering details.
Next, From the response of the postman get the Bearer Authorization code and use it in the index.js file and get the output.
The output can be seen in the http://localhost:3000/categories and the various categories be accessed in those.

For example,
For Amazon details http://localhost:3000/categories use this link
For Flipkart details http://localhost:3000/categories/FLP/products/Laptop use this link
